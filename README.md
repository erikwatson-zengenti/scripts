# Scripts 

A collection of scripts I have written to automate repetetive tasks. 

Add this project folder to the `$PATH` to make them available as commands. 


## Contensis 

Running this command launches a TMUX session with Contensis running in it.

You can not restart a Contensis session from within a Contensis session. 


### Options

  - `-r`: Reload. Kills the current session and starts a new one.
